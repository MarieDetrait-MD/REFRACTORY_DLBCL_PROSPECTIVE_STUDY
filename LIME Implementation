Implementation of LIME 
Lime is an algorithm that can explain the prediction of any classifier by approximating it locally with an interpretable model. 
This allows LIME to build a simpler, interpretable model that approximates the behavior of a more complex model locally. 
LIME helps by identifying which features, such as genetic markers or clinical history, are most influential in a prediction.
